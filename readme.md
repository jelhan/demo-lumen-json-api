# demo-lumen-json-api

This repository is only meant for testing lumen support of [laravel-json-api](https://github.com/cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api) via branch jelhan/laravel-json-api#lumen.

Currently only fetching a list of posts via `GET /api/v1/posts` is working.

Development is abandoned. Just pushing that one as a starting point for others.
